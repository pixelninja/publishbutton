# Publish Button

A button that toggles an entry's published state.

## Installation

- Upload the `/publishbutton` folder to your Symphony `/extensions` folder.
- Enable it by selecting "Publish Button", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

When this field is added to a section, a button appears which will toggle the published state. Data-sources can be filtered with a yes or no value.

When the user is logged in to Symphony, the value used for filtering and XML output will always be 'yes'.

This allows the editor to create/edit an entry (like an article), and preview it on the live site without the public seeing it.
